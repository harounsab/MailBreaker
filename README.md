# MailBreaker
This project is my first project trying to use some mail send and recieve scripts, combined with word extractors and artificial intelligence in order to smartly "try to" bypass spam filters. This will not be the full working code as it might be used for some illegal traffic. The project will gather some usefull scripts about sending, reading and extracting keywords from mails.  

To do : 

*Send Mail 

*Read Mail 

*Extract mail 

*Add periodic timer 

*Manage raw mail files

*Extend the to do list
